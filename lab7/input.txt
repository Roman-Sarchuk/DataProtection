'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' are rocks close enough to pass within seven point five million kilometres of Earth's orbit. NASA has created a map of one thousand four hundred PHAs, none of which are expected to be a threat in the next one hundred years. With technology already available, NASA can track these objects and make predictions about possible impact, at which point two defence solutions could be launched.

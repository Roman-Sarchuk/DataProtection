The first is DART - the Double Asteroid Redirection Test. Plans are scheduled to test DART on the moon of an asteroid called Didymos. 'Didymoon' is onehundred fifty metres wide, orbiting its eight hundred metre mother, and hopefully the impact of DART will knock it out of its orbit enough for Earth-based telescopes to pick up.

Another suggested defence against a PHA on course to hit Earth is to blow it up
using a nuclear weapon. It may sound like a plot from a film, and it was the
subject of the film Armageddon, but the Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission
for Emergency Response (HAMMER) is a genuine NASA proposal. The eight-ton rockets
would be fired at an approaching asteroid with the hope of bumping it off course.
If the asteroid was too close to Earth for this plan to work, the rockets would
carry nuclear bombs to blow it up instead.
